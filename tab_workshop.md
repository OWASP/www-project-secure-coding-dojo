# Running a Secure Coding Workshop using the Dojo

Bringing Software Security training to schools can have a positive impact on the security of future software. 
The Secure Coding Dojo project was created to bring knowledge about software weaknesses and security best practices to classrooms of all sizes: from universities to large companies. This workshop package is intended to facilitate security advocates to deliver training sessions using the dojo.

The workshop package is based on an event organized by the OWASP Ottawa Chapter and Secure that Cert at the University of Ottawa. Special thanks to the workshop organizers: Nancy Gariche, Garth Boyd, Miguel Garzon, Abdulwahaab Ahmed, Scott Kelly and Dave Petrasovic.

# Deploying Secure Coding Dojo

The Secure Coding Dojo runs from Docker containers. Students could easily deploy their own instance using docker-compose as described below. 
Deploying a common permanent production instance of the Dojo requires a bit more setup with instructions available on the [wiki](https://github.com/trendmicro/SecureCodingDojo/wiki/Deploying-with-Docker) .

You may also find useful the AppSec DC 2019 presentation of the project: [AppSeC Presentation](https://github.com/trendmicro/SecureCodingDojo/tree/master/AppSecDC%20Secure%20Coding%20Dojo%20Presentation)

Costs for a permanent deployment may vary from $30/month to more depending on the number of participants.

## Basic Setup

- Install Docker latest version.
- Git clone the repository
- Change directory to the repo root directory
- Configure an environment variable DATA_DIR as a mount point for the dojo files. On *nix/mac modify .bash_profile as follows

    `export DATA_DIR="/YOUR_DATA_DIR"`

- On Mac you must allow Docker access to this directory in Docker > Preferences > File Sharing
- Restart your terminal
- Run with

    `docker-compose up`
