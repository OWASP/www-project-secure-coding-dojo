### Description

The Secure Coding Dojo is a training platform which can be customized to integrate with custom vulnerable websites and other CTF challenges.

Here are some of the features:

* Integrates with Enterprise environments using Slack, Google and LDAP for authentication
* It allows grouping of participants according to their development teams
* It allows teams to track progress and compete with each other
* Each lesson is built as an attack/defence pair. Developers can observe the software weaknesses by conducting the attack and after solving the challenge they learn about the associated software defenses
* Predefined lessons are based on the MITRE most dangerous software errors (also known as SANS 25) so the focus is on software errors rather than attack techniques
* The predefined hacking challenges are created for entry level and keep the developers engaged. Only a browser is needed.
* With CTFs there is a puzzle aspect to the challenges which is great for pen-tester audiences but can make some developers lose interest. In the Secure Coding Dojo the focus is on demonstrating the vulnerability.
* There are tips that help the developers as they are exploiting the issue to avoid getting stuck
